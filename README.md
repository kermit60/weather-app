# Weather-application
## **Description**
A Weather forecast application that's a simple website that displays your location's weather built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## **Installation**
> A live deployment of this [`weather-app`](https://kermit60.github.io/weather-app/) project is available on GitHub pages.
